        <b>Kerala</b>, situated on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India, is celebrated for its breathtaking natural beauty 
        and is popularly known as “God’s Own Country.” It shares its borders with Karnataka to the north, Tamil Nadu to the 
        east, and the Arabian Sea to the west. The state was officially formed on November 1, 1956, with Thiruvananthapuram 
        as its capital. Kerala is renowned for its high literacy rate, excellent healthcare system, and social development 
        indicators, making it one of the most progressive states in India.
        <br><br>
        The culture of Kerala is rich and diverse, featuring classical art forms like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, and Theyyam, 
        as well as vibrant festivals such as Onam and Vishu. Its cuisine is distinct, relying heavily on rice, coconut, and 
        spices, and is known for dishes like Kerala Sadya and fish curry. The state’s economy thrives on agriculture, spice 
        cultivation, tourism, and significant remittances from Malayalis working abroad. Kerala’s scenic attractions include 
        the tranquil backwaters of Alleppey and Kumarakom, the hill stations of Munnar and Wayanad, pristine beaches like 
        Kovalam and Varkala, and wildlife sanctuaries such as Periyar.
